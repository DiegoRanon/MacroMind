# 🧾 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** MacroMind
**Date:** 2025-06-20

**Author:** Diego Ranon
**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Draft ✅

---

## 1. 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of **MacroMind** is to create an AI-powered health tracking app that simplifies calorie tracking, provides intelligent nutrition suggestions, and integrates with fitness wearables (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) to provide a holistic health overview — all through natural chat interaction.

---

## 2. 📌 Problem Statement

Current calorie tracking apps are time-consuming, rigid, and disconnected from other health metrics like sleep, heart rate, and steps. Users must log food manually, scan barcodes, or use clunky interfaces. Many cannot afford a personal nutritionist or coach. There’s a gap for a seamless, conversational, AI-powered solution that adapts to user goals and behaviors.

---

## 3. 🧠 Goals & Objectives

- Provide a **natural chat interface** to log food and receive feedback.
- Connect with **Fitbit or other wearables** to sync health indicators (steps, sleep, HR).
- Deliver personalized, **AI-generated daily recommendations**.
- Help users **optimize nutrition** for cutting, bulking, or general wellness.
- Be easy enough to use **daily** without friction.

---

## 4. 👥 Target Users

- Fitness enthusiasts on cutting/bulking plans.
- Everyday users aiming to improve health.
- Night-shift workers and busy professionals.
- People who want a **nutritionist-like experience** without the cost.
